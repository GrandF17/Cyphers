Here you can find "Kuznechik" implementation with OFB operating mode.

To compile use (I got 6.3 minGW32 compiler version):
`g++ ofb.cpp -o kuz.exe`

To run the compiled file you need:

`-f` - specifies that the next parameter is the path to your file that you want to encrypt.

`-k` - specifies that the next parameter is the path to the file with the bit sequence (minimum 256 bits) for the encryption key.

`-o` - offset in the file with the key (if the file contains more than 256 bits)

`-l` - the name of the file where the logs will be placed (since the implementation contains the OFB algorithm)

In this repository you can find the file `1048576.key`. This sequence of bits was generated by a quantum computer, which is an ideal source of entropy. This file has also been tested with a special test for random number generators published by the US National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST).

You can find out these test here: https://github.com/terrillmoore/NIST-Statistical-Test-Suite.
