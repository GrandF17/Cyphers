# Kuznechik OFB/CBC

Here you can find "Kuznechik" implementation with OFB operating mode.

Detailed description of OFB algo is written

To run the compiled file you need:

`--f="{FILE}"` - specifies that the next parameter is the path to your file that you want to encrypt.

`--k="{BIT_SEQUENCE}.key"` - specifies that the next parameter is the path to the file with the bit sequence (minimum 256 bits) for the encryption key. `Attention!` this file should have extencion `.key`!

`--o="{OFFSET_NUMBER}"` - offset in the file with the key (if the file contains more than 256 bits)

`--l="{LOG_FILE}"` - the name of the file where the logs will be placed (since the implementation contains the OFB algorithm)

`--mode="{0/1/2}"` - number of mode in which program will run:

0 - encryption of file;

1 - decryption of file;

2 - tests;

`--checksum="{0/1}"` - boolean value `generate` or `not` md5 checksum of executable file.

In this repository you can find the file `1048576.key`. This sequence of bits was generated by a quantum computer, which is an ideal source of entropy. This file has also been tested with a special test for random number generators published by the US National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST).

## LINUX 
### gcc version 11.4.0

Compile:

```
make -f makefile.mk
```

Example how to run:

```
./main -k="1048576.key" -o="0" -l="log.txt" --f="./kek.txt" -mode="2" -rc="0"
```

### P.S. Can be run only on Unix OSs
